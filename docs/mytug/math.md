# Mathematics

TeX is easy to use and excellent at typesetting mathematics. For
example, the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx +c = 0\) has solutions
\[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
\]

With TeX you type math as a sequence, much as you think or say them.
To get this input, type
```tex
the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx +c = 0\) has solutions
\[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
\]
```

With TeX, you can keep your hands on the keyboard. No more clumsy
fiddling with the trackpad on your laptop.
